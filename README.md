this is one of my personal projects, it is a small watch where you can set an alarm ,use a stop watch , I made it using esp idf , and an ssd306 screen which i wrote a mini driver for , it was a very good learning experience , learnt a lot about freeRtos , interrupts gptimer ..., still wanting to improver it by adding new features
